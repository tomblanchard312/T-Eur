# Tokenized Euro (tEUR) Project

## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains a technical reference implementation for exploring the operational, governance, and resilience aspects of a tokenized euro system. The implementation is designed as a research tool to examine distributed ledger technology in the context of financial settlement systems.

## 2. What This Project Is

This project provides:

- A simulated distributed ledger environment for studying settlement mechanics
- Reference implementations of smart contracts for token management
- Infrastructure components for multi-zone deployment scenarios
- Documentation of governance and compliance frameworks
- Test environments for resilience and security analysis

## 3. What This Project Is Not

This project does not:

- Constitute a currency or payment system
- Provide production-ready financial infrastructure
- Represent endorsement by any regulatory authority
- Include live monetary value or real settlement capabilities
- Serve as a basis for commercial deployment

## 4. Governance and Authority Model

The implementation simulates a hierarchical governance structure with the following roles:

- Central authority simulation for settlement coordination
- National node simulations for regional operations
- Participant simulations for commercial entities
- Governance mechanisms for policy enforcement

All roles are simulated for research purposes only and do not confer actual authority.

## 5. Risk and Compliance Alignment

The project incorporates:

- Multi-zone isolation for operational resilience
- Cryptographic controls for data integrity
- Audit logging for transaction traceability
- Compliance frameworks for regulatory alignment
- Risk mitigation strategies for system stability

## 6. Security and Safety Posture

Security measures include:

- Cryptographic key management
- Network segmentation
- Access control mechanisms
- Secure communication protocols
- Incident response procedures

All security implementations are for research and testing purposes.

## 7. Intended Audience

This project is intended for:

- Researchers studying distributed ledger technology
- Regulatory authorities examining financial system design
- Academic institutions exploring digital asset frameworks
- Technical professionals analyzing system resilience
