## Scenario Title

Execution of Emergency Wallet Freeze for Sanctions Compliance.

## Learning Objectives

- Correctly identify the target wallet address.

- Understand the audit trail generated by the action.

## Preconditions

- Operator has `ECB_ADMIN` role.
- Operator possesses a valid `ISSUING` key.
- Access to the Closed Settlement Plane (CSP) is established.

## Initial System State

- Balance is €1,250.00.
- System status is `ACTIVE`.

## Triggering Event

Receipt of an official legal order (Case ID: 2026-001) requiring the immediate freezing of the target wallet due to sanctions listing.

## Step-by-Step Actions

1. **Authentication**: Log in to the Sovereign Control Portal using mTLS and the `ISSUING` key.
2. **Identification**: Enter the target address `0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F` in the Sanctions UI.
3. **Justification**: Enter the mandatory justification: "Emergency Sanctions Compliance - Case ID: 2026-001".

5. **Verification**: Query the account status to confirm `frozen: true`.

## Expected System Responses

- Audit log records `ACCOUNT_FROZEN` event.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Entering the wrong wallet address (always use copy-paste).
