# Executive Summary: Tokenized Euro (tEUR) Project

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document provides a high-level overview of the tEUR project, a technical reference implementation developed to explore operational, governance, and resilience considerations in distributed ledger systems for financial settlement. The project serves as a research tool for examining system design principles without constituting operational infrastructure.

## 2. What the Project Explores

The project examines:

- Distributed ledger mechanics for settlement processes
- Multi-zone operational architectures
- Governance frameworks for hierarchical systems
- Security controls and resilience patterns
- Compliance alignment with regulatory requirements

## 3. What the Project Explicitly Does Not Do

The project does not:

- Create or issue any form of currency
- Provide functional payment or settlement systems
- Represent endorsement by regulatory authorities
- Include real monetary value or live transactions
- Serve as a basis for production deployment

## 4. Governance and Authority Boundaries

The implementation simulates governance structures with defined roles for research purposes:

- Simulated central coordination functions
- Simulated regional operational nodes
- Simulated participant entities
- Policy enforcement mechanisms

All simulated roles exist solely for study and confer no actual authority.

## 5. Risk, Resilience, and Compliance Posture

The project incorporates:

- Isolation mechanisms for operational stability
- Cryptographic integrity controls
- Audit capabilities for transaction tracking
- Regulatory alignment frameworks
- Risk mitigation approaches for system reliability

## 6. Intended Use and Audience

The project is designed for:

- Academic and research institutions
- Regulatory bodies examining system architectures
- Technical professionals studying resilience
- Policy makers evaluating governance models
