Dear [Appropriate Contact or "Central Bank Technical Team"],

## Purpose

We are writing to respectfully request non-binding technical feedback on a reference architecture and research implementation exploring distributed ledger concepts in financial settlement systems. This work is conducted as a research exercise to examine system design principles and does not constitute operational infrastructure or imply any authority to issue currency.

## Research Intent

The project provides a technical reference implementation for studying:

- Distributed ledger mechanics for settlement coordination
- Governance frameworks for hierarchical systems
- Security controls and resilience patterns
- Compliance alignment with regulatory requirements

All components are simulated for research purposes only and do not represent functional systems.

## Materials Provided

We have prepared the following materials for your review:

- Reference Architecture Document: Conceptual design exploring governance and control structures
- Executive Summary: High-level overview of research objectives and scope
- Technical Briefing: Detailed explanation of architectural approaches

These documents are available in the project repository for your consideration.

## Request for Technical Observations

We would welcome any technical observations your experts might have on the architectural approaches presented. Comments on resilience patterns, security controls, governance models, or other technical aspects would be valuable for refining our research framework. We understand that providing feedback is discretionary and may not be possible given your operational priorities.

## Acknowledgement

We fully acknowledge that the [National Central Bank Name] may decline to provide feedback, and we respect any decision in this regard. This request does not imply any expectation of response or endorsement.

Thank you for considering this request. We value the opportunity to engage with central bank expertise in advancing research on financial system design.

Sincerely,
