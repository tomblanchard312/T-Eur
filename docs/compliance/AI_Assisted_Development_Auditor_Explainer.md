# Auditor Explainer: AI-Assisted Development Controls

This document explains how AI-assisted development is governed in the tEUR project.

## Key Principles
- AI tools are constrained by written instructions
- Instructions are version controlled
- CI enforces instruction integrity
- AI output is subject to the same controls as human-written code

## Regulatory Alignment
- DORA: ICT risk is controlled by design-time enforcement
- ISO 27001: Secure development lifecycle controls are automated
- OWASP: Unsafe patterns are prevented before merge

## Auditor Assurance
AI assistance does not bypass controls. It is constrained, observable, and auditable.
